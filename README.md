# MachineLearning-PCA-LogReg

# installations
you need to install all of these;
    pillow 
    seaborn
    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib

so run;
pip install pillow seaborn pandas numpy matplotlib
(I used pip3 as I am on macOS. Use pip3 if pip doesn't work for you.)

For the second question, also install the notebook package:
pip install notebook

# Dataset
"fake" and "mnist" folders should be with source files.
If you have any issue with reading dataset make sure the path for datasets are correct in all files, and check the current directory you are in the terminal.

# PCA Analysis 
To run the first question (pcaanalysis.py):

    Open the file in your IDE (e.g., VS Code).
    Click the Run button or press F5.

# Logistic Regression
The second question is in logreg.py. You can run it by same instructions with pcaanalysis.py,
but as this process may take more time, I have also split it into smaller code segments in q2.ipynb.

You can choose how to run the second question:

    Open q2.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
    Run the cells step by step.

# Additional config details
If you encounter errors during installation, ensure your Python and pip versions are up-to-date:
python --version
pip --version
pip install --upgrade pip
